This kernel is from 
PROCESSOR-SDK-LINUX-AM335X v04.00

This is a shallow clone starting with the release
for the sdk found in the board_support subdirectory
of the sdk installation.

Here are the commands used to create it (from a
local copy of the ti sdk kernel git repo).

git clone --depth 2 file:///home/aaron/gs/linux/ti/linux-4.9.28+gitAUTOINC+eed43d1050-geed43d1050


git filter-branch -- --all
